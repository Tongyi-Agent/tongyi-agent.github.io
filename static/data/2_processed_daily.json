  "answer_end": "\nBased on public records and real estate listings, you are interested in comparing the 2022 sale prices for two homes in Pearl City, Hawaii—2072 Akaikai Loop and 2017 Komo Mai Drive—to better understand recent market activity in your area.\n\n**Sale Prices in 2022**\n\nIn December 2022, 2072 Akaikai Loop was sold for $860,000. This property, located in the Pearl City area of Oahu, changed hands after a brief period when it was listed at $850,000 earlier that year. The transaction reflects the active nature of the local housing market during this time, with several sources consistently reporting this $860,000 figure for the end-of-year sale.\n\nFor 2017 Komo Mai Drive, the most relevant 2022 sale data shows that the house was sold twice within the same month, both times for $900,000. Public records and MLS sources indicate that these transactions occurred in early August 2022. Notably, while the property was initially listed for $875,000, it ultimately sold for a higher price, demonstrating strong demand in the neighborhood even during a potentially competitive real estate climate.\n\n**Comparison of Sale Prices**\n\nComparing the two properties based on their sale prices in 2022:\n\n| Address               | Sale Price (2022) |\n|-----------------------|------------------|\n| 2072 Akaikai Loop     | $860,000         |\n| 2017 Komo Mai Drive   | $900,000         |\n\nFrom this table, it is clear that 2017 Komo Mai Drive sold for more than 2072 Akaikai Loop in 2022.\n\n**Which Home Sold for More in 2022?**\n\nOf the two homes, **2017 Komo Mai Drive** sold for the higher amount in 2022. Its sale price was **$900,000**.\n\n**Summary of Findings**\n\n- **2072 Akaikai Loop:** Sold for $860,000 in December 2022.\n- **2017 Komo Mai Drive:** Sold for $900,000 in August 2022.\n- The home at **2017 Komo Mai Drive** sold for more in 2022, with a sale price of **900000** (without commas or decimal places, as requested).\n\nUnderstanding the recent sale prices of comparable homes in your area can be invaluable when setting a competitive asking price or assessing your own home’s value. The slightly higher sale price for 2017 Komo Mai Drive may reflect differences in property features, location preferences, or buyer demand during that specific period. Keep in mind, however, that each home’s unique characteristics can greatly influence its market value. When selling, considering these recent transactions will help you position your home effectively in the current Pearl City market.",

      "thought": "We need to find sale prices for two properties: 2072 Akaikai Loop, Pearl City, HI (on Oahu) and 2017 Komo Mai Drive, Pearl City, HI. Specifically sold in 2022. Determine which sold for more and report that amount without commas or decimals.\n\nWe must use web search and possibly site visits. The question asks \"Find which of those homes sold for more in 2022, and tell me how much it sold for. Don't put commas or decimal places in the answer.\" So final answer should be just a number (the sale price) presumably with no formatting. But we also might mention which home? The request: \"Find which of those homes sold for more in 2022, and tell me how much it sold for.\" So we need to determine which property had higher price and give that price. Probably we can say like \"The home at X sold for more, at $Y.\" However instruction says don't put commas or decimal places, so $Y without commas.\n\nWe need to fetch data. Use search queries to locate property sale records. Likely sources: Hawaii's public records, such as Honolulu County property tax website, online real estate sites like Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com, etc.\n\nWe'll use search tool with queries:\n\n- \"2072 Akaikai Loop Pearl City HI sold 2022\"\n- \"2017 Komo Mai Drive Pearl City HI sold 2022\"\n- Possibly include \"sale price\" \"2022\" \"Honolulu County\" etc.\n\nThen we need to open appropriate result pages to extract sale price.\n\nLet's do a search.",

Earlier in 2022 it was listed for sale at $850,000 on October 21, 2022 and entered a contingent status at $850,000 on October 31, 2022. No other sales in 2022 are recorded."

      "thought": "Now we have both sale prices:\n\n- 2072 Akaikai Loop sold Dec 14, 2022 for $860,000.\n- 2017 Komo Mai Drive sold Aug 1 or Aug 5, 2022 for $900,000.\n\nThus the higher sale price is $900,000 (2017 Komo Mai Drive). The answer should be the amount without commas or decimal places: \"900000\". Probably they want just the number. We could also mention which home sold for more. The user asked: \"Find which of those homes sold for more in 2022, and tell me how much it sold for. Don’t put commas or decimal places in the answer.\" So answer should state maybe \"The home at 2017 Komo Mai Drive sold for more, at 900000.\" However we need to consider not including commas or decimals; 900000 is fine.\n\nWe might provide a brief explanation. Let's craft final answer.\n\nBut before finalize, verify if any possible other sale price for 2072 Akaikai Loop in 2022 that is higher? There is also a listing at $850,000 then sold at $860,000. So $860k is correct.\n\nNow confirm if 2017 Komo Mai Drive had any other sale price in 2022 besides $900k. Possibly a sale at $875,000? The Compass page shows listing at $875,000 on June 21 2022, but sale price is $900,000. So indeed $900k is correct.\n\nOne might question if there were multiple sales (like one for $875k earlier). But the sale price is $900k. So answer is 900000.\n\nThus final answer: 2017 Komo Mai Drive sold for more, at 900000.\n\nWe could include the exact amount only as number per instruction. Usually such tasks ask to give just the number. The user says \"Find which of those homes sold for more in 2022, and tell me how much it sold for.\" That suggests they want to know which property and the price. So I'll respond: \"2017 Komo Mai Drive sold for more, at 900000.\" Should be okay.\n\nNow produce final answer.",
