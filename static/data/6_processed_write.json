Introduction\n\nReinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in environments with sparse rewards—where feedback is rare—and those requiring strict adherence to safety or operational constraints. Efficient and proactive exploration allows agents to discover useful behaviors even when external rewards are infrequent, while constraint-aware methods ensure agents operate safely within physical, legal, or system boundaries. These advancements have profound implications for trajectory planning, which is critical in domains such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.\n\nThis report summarizes the latest research progress in these areas and discusses their impact on trajectory planning. It covers intrinsic motivation techniques for exploration, hierarchical and goal-conditioned approaches, model-based active exploration strategies, and constraint-handling methods. Additionally, it analyzes how these developments inform and enhance trajectory planning processes.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Efficient and Proactive Exploration Under Sparse Rewards\n\n#### 2.1 Intrinsic Motivation and Novelty Detection\n\nA major breakthrough in RL for sparse reward environments is the development of intrinsic motivation mechanisms. Agents equipped with these techniques use internal rewards to explore novel states and behaviors, thereby increasing the probability of encountering external rewards.\n\n- **Self-Supervised Network Distillation (SND):** This method employs distillation error as a novelty signal, guiding exploration toward states where prediction is difficult. Experiments show faster convergence and higher reward attainment compared to traditional baselines in challenging environments.\n- **Random Network Distillation (RND):** Predicting outputs from a fixed random network highlights unexpected states, providing consistent exploration incentives independent of task success.\n- **Count-Based Exploration:** Encourages visiting less-explored states by rewarding inversely proportional visit counts, improving coverage and reducing redundant exploration.\n- **Episodic Memory and Lifelong Novelty:** Techniques such as those in Never Give Up (NGU) combine episodic and long-term novelty to maintain exploratory drives across extended learning periods.\n\nThese approaches enable agents to overcome reward sparsity by proactively seeking out informative experiences.\n\n#### 2.2 Goal-Conditioned and Hierarchical Exploration\n\nDecomposing complex tasks into manageable subgoals facilitates exploration in high-dimensional spaces and sparse reward landscapes.\n\n- **Hierarchical RL (HRL):** Uses high-level controllers to set subgoals for lower-level controllers, simplifying long-horizon planning. Methods like HRL with multi-goal navigation demonstrate improved performance on tasks where single-step reward signals are unattainable.\n- **Goal-Conditioned Policies:** Allow agents to switch goals dynamically, encouraging exploration along diverse trajectories and enhancing sample efficiency.\n- **Skills Discovery and Curriculum Generation:** Algorithms autonomously generate skills relevant to the current environment state, progressively adapting exploration to task demands.\n\nThese methods mirror human-like planning, breaking down complex maneuvers into actionable steps, which is directly applicable to trajectory planning in robotics and autonomous systems.\n\n#### 2.3 Model-Based Active Exploration and Uncertainty\n\nModel-based RL leverages predictions about environment dynamics to plan and execute exploratory actions, focusing effort on uncertain regions.\n\n- **Plan2Explore:** Builds world models to maximize information gain, then leverages these models for effective exploration and planning in previously unseen scenarios.\n- **E-MCTS (Epistemic Monte Carlo Tree Search):** Propagates epistemic uncertainty through search trees, allowing agents to actively seek out ambiguous state transitions, balancing exploration and exploitation intelligently.\n- **Bayesian Ensembles and Active Model Identification:** Multiple learned dynamics models identify regions of high uncertainty, directing exploration towards reducing model ambiguity and accelerating learning.\n\nSuch strategies dramatically improve sample efficiency and enable rapid adaptation to environmental changes—a crucial asset for trajectory planning in dynamic, partially known settings.\n\n#### 2.4 Emerging Trends in Exploration\n\nCurrent research is moving toward integrating multiple objectives and leveraging foundation models. For example, curiosity-driven bonuses are mixed with information-theoretic and multi-goal objectives to enhance robustness. Meta-learning techniques train exploration policies to generalize across different tasks, while foundation models act as priors for targeted exploration in complex domains.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Exploration Under Constraints\n\nSafe RL aims to optimize behavior while respecting predefined constraints, ensuring agents do not violate operational, safety, or legal boundaries during learning and deployment.\n\n#### 3.1 CMDP Formulations and Lagrangian Approaches\n\n- **Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs):** Formalize constraint satisfaction within the RL framework, typically solved via primal-dual optimization or Lagrangian methods.\n- **Lagrangian Policy Gradient and Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO):** Maximize returns subject to constraint budgets, adjusting penalties dynamically to ensure feasibility.\n\nModern algorithms remove restrictive assumptions—such as knowing all safe actions beforehand—and expand applicability to complex, nonlinear contexts.\n\n#### 3.2 Safe Exploration with Hard Instantaneous Constraints\n\nNew approaches address scenarios where agents must avoid unsafe actions at every step, even during learning.\n\n- **LSVI-AE Algorithm:** Achieves minimal regret and constraint violations for both linear and kernelized (RKHS) cost functions. It encourages aggressive exploration without prior knowledge of safe actions, demonstrating strong performance in uncertain environments.\n- **Verification Principles and Barriers:** Methods like VELM provide formal guarantees for safety during training and deployment, reinforcing trust in learned policies.\n\n#### 3.3 Versatile Safe RL and Zero-Shot Adaptation\n\nTo cope with dynamic operational settings, recent work develops frameworks that adapt to varying safety constraints quickly.\n\n- **Constraint-Conditioned Policy Optimization (CCPO):** Employs value estimation and variational inference modules to encode arbitrary constraint thresholds, supporting rapid adaptation without retraining.\n- **Shielded Planning Guided Policy Optimization (SPPO):** Integrates path planning and shielding mechanisms with model predictive control for guaranteed safety during exploration and policy improvement.\n\nThese methods ensure agents maintain safety margins while retaining flexibility and adaptability.\n\n#### 3.4 Verification and Multi-Agent Safety\n\nFormal verification and barrier function approaches are increasingly deployed to certify safe policies in multi-agent and competitive settings, expanding the reach of safe RL beyond single-agent tasks.\n\n#### 3.5 Risk-Sensitive and Distributional RL\n\nRisk-sensitive techniques optimize policies considering uncertainty distributions, while distributional RL incorporates probabilistic outcomes for better constraint management.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Implications for Trajectory Planning Problems\n\nTrajectory planning is the process of determining optimal movement paths for agents, ensuring collision avoidance, smooth motion, and adherence to operational constraints. The advances in exploration and constraint handling directly impact and transform this domain.\n\n#### 4.1 Sample-Efficient Planning in Sparse Reward Settings\n\nBy integrating intrinsic motivation and model-based exploration, agents accelerate learning of viable trajectories even when direct feedback is unavailable. Methods inspired by Go-Explore and E-MCTS promote systematic coverage and prioritization of promising paths, reducing unnecessary exploration in unfamiliar environments.\n\n#### 4.2 Decomposition and Multi-Stage Planning\n\nHierarchical RL and multi-objective reward schemes enable decomposing complex motion tasks into sequential stages—such as approach, adjustment, and completion phases. This mirrors practical trajectory planning in robotics, where joint control and motion smoothing are vital for reliability and performance.\n\n#### 4.3 Safe Trajectory Generation\n\nConstraint-aware algorithms ensure trajectories respect physical and safety boundaries, critical for deployment in robotics, autonomous driving, and industrial automation. Techniques like shielded planning, advantage-based shielding, and zero-shot adaptation allow continuous operation under changing conditions, maintaining safety throughout learning and execution.\n\n#### 4.4 Real-World Case Studies\n\n- **Robotic Arms:** The M2ACD algorithm, featuring dual actor-critic networks and a two-stage reward strategy, demonstrates accelerated convergence and smoother motion than baseline methods.\n- **Autonomous Driving:** Frameworks like Plan-R1 apply language modeling principles to sequential trajectory prediction, enforcing safety, comfort, and compliance via reinforcement fine-tuning.\n- **General-Purpose Robotics:** SPPO provides explicit theoretical guarantees for safe exploration, enabling broader application of RL-based planning in unstructured or hazardous environments.\n\n#### 4.5 Trade-offs and Multi-Objective Optimization\n\nTrajectory planning often involves balancing multiple objectives—speed, energy consumption, safety, and comfort. Constrained and multi-objective RL methods facilitate principled trade-offs, generating policies that optimize overall utility while meeting essential requirements.\n\n#### 4.6 Theoretical Assurance and Risk Bounding\n\nTheoretical results from safe RL provide confidence intervals for planning decisions, quantify learning risks, and bound constraint violations. Such assurances are indispensable for safety-critical deployments, offering both technical rigor and operational reliability.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Open Challenges and Future Directions\n\nDespite significant progress, several challenges persist:\n\n- **Scalability to High-Dimensional Spaces:** Extending exploration and constraint-handling methods to very high-dimensional or continuous action spaces remains technically demanding.\n- **Generalization Across Tasks:** Ensuring learned behaviors transfer effectively to new environments or tasks without retraining is crucial but nontrivial.\n- **Real-Time Performance:** Practical deployment demands solutions with low computational overhead and rapid decision-making capabilities.\n- **Perception Integration:** Incorporating real-world sensor information into planning loops to reduce uncertainty and improve robustness is an active area of research.\n\nFuture research will likely focus on hybrid model-free/model-based strategies, adaptive exploration driven by foundation models, learned barrier functions, and seamless integration of perception and planning.\n\n---\n\n### 6.

Conclusion\n\nRecent advances in reinforcement learning have substantially enhanced the ability of agents to explore efficiently and operate safely within complex, constraint-rich environments. Intrinsic motivation and model-based exploration accelerate learning in sparse reward scenarios, while sophisticated constraint-handling frameworks ensure safety and compliance. These developments translate directly into transformative capabilities for trajectory planning, enabling reliable, adaptable, and efficient motion generation across robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation. As the field continues to evolve, bridging theoretical advances with practical deployment and scaling to ever-larger and more uncertain environments will be paramount.",

The phrase \"and constraints, respectively\" suggests that they want two separate summaries: (1) research for efficient proactive exploration under sparse rewards; (2) research for dealing with constraints while exploring.\n\nThen they want analysis and discussion of potential implications and insights for trajectory planning problems.\n\nThus answer must have sections:\n\n- Introduction: brief overview\n\n- Recent research progress for efficient exploration under sparse rewards: e.g., intrinsic motivation, curiosity-driven RL, count-based exploration, predictive models, Random Network Distillation (RND), Never Give Up (NGU), Go-Explore, IMPALA+Muesli, etc.; meta-RL; hierarchical RL; goal-conditioned policies; unsupervised RL; skill discovery; empowerment; information gain; maximum entropy RL; reward shaping; extrinsic-intrinsic balance; hindsight experience replay; offline RL for sample efficiency; data augmentation; multi-objective RL.\n\nRecent works: \"Exploration via Random Network Distillation\" (Burda et al. 2020), \"Never Give Up: Learning Directed Exploration Strategies\" (Badia et al. 2020?), \"Go-Explore\" (Ecoffet et al., 2021) for extremely sparse reward. Also \"Plan2Explore\", \"DreamerV3\". \"SMiRL\", \"UCB exploration for deep RL\". \"Muesli\" uses mixture of exploration objectives. \"Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM)\" earlier but still relevant. \"Contrastive Predictive Coding for Exploration\".\n\nAlso \"Proactive\" implies anticipation, maybe proactive policy search like \"Proactive Exploration\" methods: \"Proactive Adaptive Planning\" or \"Goal-conditioned policies\" which plan ahead; \"Meta-World\" tasks.\n\nRecent developments in model-based RL for efficient exploration: \"MuZero\", \"Dream to Explore\", \"Plan2Explore\", \"E3B\" (Exploiting Epistemic Uncertainty), \"Bayesian Model Ensembles\".\n\nAlso \"Active learning for RL\", \"Uncertainty-aware exploration\", \"Information-directed sampling\".\n\nAdditionally, \"Constrained RL\": research on exploration under constraints like safety constraints.

RL can be used for planning by learning policies to produce trajectories. Insights from efficient exploration help in planning for unknown environments (e.g., robotics). Sparse rewards correspond to success/failure signals only at final goal, making planning difficult. Methods like intrinsic motivation could guide exploration of state space to find feasible trajectories, akin to coverage planning. Also hierarchical RL can decompose planning into subgoals.\n\nConstrained exploration research informs how to incorporate safety constraints (collision avoidance, dynamic feasibility) during planning, ensuring that sampled trajectories respect constraints while exploring. This is valuable for safe trajectory planning in autonomous vehicles, drones, robots.\n\nPotential implications: better sample-efficient planning algorithms, ability to plan in high-dimensional continuous spaces, real-time adaptability, integration of model-based planning with exploration bonuses, multi-objective optimization for trade-offs between cost and safety.\n\nNeed to discuss synergy: e.g., integrating Go-Explore style return-to-previously visited states could aid in exploring feasible trajectories for planning under constraints. Using uncertainty estimates from ensemble models can focus planning on uncertain regions to reduce risk. Using constrained RL frameworks to guarantee safety constraints while exploring, leading to safe online planning.\n\nThus answer will cover each subtopic, highlight key papers and contributions, then transition to implications for trajectory planning.\n\nWe should provide citations (authors and year). Could optionally provide a table summarizing main approaches.\n\nWe also need to \"cleverly leverage appropriate tools assist question answering.\" We can use web search to retrieve recent literature on \"exploration sparse rewards reinforcement learning 2023 2024\", \"constrained reinforcement learning 2023 2024\", \"trajectory planning reinforcement learning\".

However, such an approach becomes very problematic if the reward is too sparse and so the agent does not come across the reward during the environmental exploration. The solution to such a problem may be to equip the agent with an intrinsic motivation that will provide informed exploration during which the agent is likely to also encounter external reward. Novelty detection is one of the promising branches of intrinsic motivation research. **We present Self-supervised Network Distillation (SND), a class of intrinsic motivation algorithms based on the distillation error as a novelty indicator, where the predictor model and the target model are both trained.** We adapted three existing self-supervised methods for this purpose and experimentally tested them on a set of ten environments that are considered difficult to explore. **The results show that our approach achieves faster growth and higher external reward for the same training time compared to the baseline models, which implies improved exploration in a very sparse reward environment. In addition, the analytical methods we applied provide valuable explanatory insights into our proposed models.**\n\nSummary: \nThe paper introduces Self-supervised Network Distillation (SND), an intrinsic‑motivation technique that uses prediction‑distillation error as a novelty signal to guide exploration in sparse‑reward reinforcement learning tasks. It adapts three existing self‑supervised learning methods, evaluates them across ten challenging environments, and demonstrates that SND yields faster learning progress and higher external rewards than baseline approaches, while also offering analytical insights into its behavior."

Existing studies have considered safe RL with hard instantaneous constraints, but their approaches rely on several key assumptions: (i) the RL agent knows a safe action set for {\\it every} state or knows a {\\it safe graph} in which all the state-action-state triples are safe, and (ii) the constraint/cost functions are {\\it linear}. In this paper, we consider safe RL with instantaneous hard constraints without assumption (i) and generalize (ii) to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Our proposed algorithm, LSVI-AE, achieves \\tilde{\\cO}(\\sqrt{d^3H^4K}) regret and \\tilde{\\cO}(H \\sqrt{dK}) hard constraint violation when the cost function is linear and \\cO(H\\gamma_K \\sqrt{K}) hard constraint violation when the cost function belongs to RKHS. Here K is the learning horizon, H is the length of each episode, and \\gamma_K is the information gain w.r.t the kernel used to approximate cost functions. Our results achieve the optimal dependency on the learning horizon K, matching the lower bound we provide in this paper and demonstrating the efficiency of LSVI-AE. Notably, the design of our approach encourages aggressive policy exploration, providing a unique perspective on safe RL with general cost functions and no prior knowledge of safe actions, which may be of independent interest.\n\nSummary: \nThe paper addresses safe reinforcement learning with hard instantaneous constraints, removing the need for prior knowledge of safe actions and extending cost functions from linear to RKHS representations. It introduces the LSVI‑AE algorithm, which attains \\tilde{O}(√{d^3H^4K}) regret and \\tilde{O}(H√{dK}) (linear costs) or O(H\\gamma_K√{K}) (RKHS costs) hard constraint violations, matching optimal lower bounds. A hallmark of LSVI‑AE is its aggressive exploration strategy, offering a novel approach to safe RL without restrictive safety assumptions."

In this work, we formulate the versatile safe RL problem and consider two primary requirements: training efficiency and zero-shot adaptation capability. To address them, we introduce the Conditioned Constrained Policy Optimization (CCPO) framework, consisting of two key modules: (1) Versatile Value Estimation (VVE) for approximating value functions under unseen threshold conditions, and (2) Conditioned Variational Inference (CVI) for encoding arbitrary constraint thresholds during policy optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CCPO outperforms the baselines in terms of safety and task performance while preserving zero-shot adaptation capabilities to different constraint thresholds data-efficiently. This makes our approach suitable for real‑world dynamic applications.\n\nSummary: \nThe paper proposes Conditioned Constrained Policy Optimization (CCPO), a versatile safe RL framework designed for training efficiency and zero‑shot adaptation to varying safety constraints.

First, the paper presents a general inverse kinematics algorithm that transforms the inverse kinematics problem into a general Newton-MP iterative method. The M2ACD algorithm based on multiple actors and critics is structured. The dual-actor network reduces the overestimation of action values, minimizes the correlation between the actor and value networks, and mitigates instability during the actor’s selection process caused by excessively high Q-values. The dual-critic network reduces the estimation bias of Q-values, ensuring more reliable action selection and enhancing the stability of Q-value estimation. Secondly, The robotic manipulator’s TSR (two-stage reward) strategy is designed and divided into the approach and close. Rewards in the approach phase focuses on safely and efficiently approaching the target, and rewards in the close phase involves final adjustments before contact is made with the target. Thirdly, to solve the position hopping jitter problem in traditional reinforcement learning trajectory planning, the NURBS(Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) curve is used to smooth the hopping trajectory generated by M2ACD. Finally, the correctness of the M2ACD and the kinematics algorithm is verified by experiments. The M2ACD algorithm demonstrated superior curve smoothing, convergence stability and convergence speed compared to the TD3, DARC and DDPG algorithms. The M2ACD algorithm can be effectively applied to collaborative robots’ trajectory planning, establishing a foundation for subsequent research.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis paper presents a novel M2ACD algorithm for robotic arm trajectory planning in robots based on the structure of a multi‑strategy network and a multi‑value network. In addition, the paper proposes a reward strategy based on reward value prioritization and divides the robotic arm grasping task into the approach and close based on the TSR strategy. In order to improve the smoothness of reinforcement learning trajectory planning, NURBS spline is used to smooth the trajectory of M2ACD reinforcement learning output. The M2ACD algorithm is employed in a simulation environment to train the robot’s trajectory planning strategy, which is then transferred to a real experimental platform for grasping experiments. Simulation and real robotic arm experiments show that the proposed M2ACD algorithm is significantly more effective than TD3 and DDPG algorithms, and the M2ACD algorithm takes less time and converges faster than TD3 and DDPG algorithms in the early exploration stage. The planned curve has a good smooth line, which can effectively eliminate unnecessary fluctuations while ensuring accuracy.\n\nFuture research will focus on combining vision sensor technology to explore real-time obstacle avoidance planning methods of the M2ACD algorithm in complex obstacle environments. Specifically, the obstacle image information captured by the vision sensor is replaced with the environmental feature information suitable for the state space of the M2ACD algorithm. Regarding reward mechanism design, a positive reward is provided for each successful collision avoidance behavior, and enormous punishment is imposed on the collision behavior to restrain the potential risk. Use real-time feedback from the environment for dynamic adjustment to improve obstacle avoidance in complex and dynamically changing environments. To further enhance its adaptability and robustness in practical application scenarios.\n\nSummary: \nThe paper introduces the M2ACD (Multi‑Actor‑Critic Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm for robotic manipulator trajectory planning. It combines a generalized Newton‑MP inverse‑kinematics solver with a dual‑actor/dual‑critic DRL architecture that reduces Q‑value bias and overestimation, plus a two‑stage reward (TSR) scheme that separately rewards approaching and closing phases. To eliminate position‑hopping jitter, the output trajectory is smoothed with NURBS curves. Experimental results in simulation and on a real 7‑axis collaborative robot demonstrate that M2ACD achieves faster convergence, higher stability, and smoother, more accurate paths than TD3, DDPG, and DARC, confirming its practical applicability and laying groundwork for future vision‑guided, obstacle‑aware extensions."

Also multi-objective RL for trajectory planning.\n\nNow we need to synthesize a comprehensive answer:\n\n- Summarize recent progress for efficient proactive exploration under sparse rewards: includes intrinsic motivation methods (e.g., Self-supervised Network Distillation, RND, ICM, Count-based, episodic memory), curiosity-driven approaches, goal-conditioned policies, hierarchical RL for subgoal discovery, exploration via world models (Plan2Explore, Go-Explore, E-MCTS), model-based planning for exploration (uncertainty estimation, active learning, epistemic uncertainty in MCTS).

Methods like Go-Explore (archive of states) inspire \"state-space coverage\" strategies for sampling plausible trajectories. Model-based planning with epistemic uncertainty (E-MCTS) can prioritize exploration of uncertain regions leading to more robust trajectories.\n\n-- Hierarchical RL and skill discovery provide subgoal decomposition for complex tasks (multi-stage planning), analogous to waypoint planning or staged motion (approach vs close phases). The two-stage reward design (TSR) in M2ACD is similar to hierarchical decomposition used in HRL.\n\n-- Proactive exploration yields efficient sample usage and enables faster convergence for trajectory planners, making RL-based planning practical for real robots.\n\n-- Constraint-aware RL informs safe trajectory planning: algorithms that enforce constraints can be directly applied to avoid collisions, respect dynamic limits, adhere to speed limits, comply with traffic rules. Methods like CPO, LSVI-AE, CCPO, SPPO show how to embed constraints in the learning loop with theoretical guarantees. Their shielded planning and advantage-based shielding provide safety during both training and deployment, essential for robotics and autonomous vehicles.\n\n-- Multi-objective RL for trajectory planning (balance cost, safety, comfort) is a natural extension of constrained RL, enabling trade-offs among competing objectives. Papers like Plan-R1 integrate rule-based rewards and RL fine-tuning for safety, comfort, and compliance.\n\n-- Integration of world models (Plan2Explore, E-MCTS) allows fast simulation of candidate trajectories, reducing reliance on costly forward dynamics evaluation; thus accelerate planning cycles.\n\n-- Theoretical guarantees from safe RL (regret bounds, constraint violation bounds) provide confidence intervals for planning decisions, important for safety-critical applications.\n\n-- Challenges remain: scaling to high-dimensional continuous spaces, generalization across tasks, handling stochasticity, real-time performance, handling non-stationary constraints.\n\nFinally, discuss future directions: hybrid model-free / model-based planning, using foundation models for exploration, learning to satisfy constraints via learned barrier certificates, integrating perception into the planning state, applying advanced RL exploration to offline RL for planning with limited data.\n\nNow structure answer:\n\n1.

Introduction\n\nReinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in environments with sparse rewards—where feedback is rare—and those requiring strict adherence to safety or operational constraints. Efficient and proactive exploration allows agents to discover useful behaviors even when external rewards are infrequent, while constraint-aware methods ensure agents operate safely within physical, legal, or system boundaries. These advancements have profound implications for trajectory planning, which is critical in domains such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.\n\nThis report summarizes the latest research progress in these areas and discusses their impact on trajectory planning. It covers intrinsic motivation techniques for exploration, hierarchical and goal-conditioned approaches, model-based active exploration strategies, and constraint-handling methods. Additionally, it analyzes how these developments inform and enhance trajectory planning processes.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Efficient and Proactive Exploration Under Sparse Rewards\n\n#### 2.1 Intrinsic Motivation and Novelty Detection\n\nA major breakthrough in RL for sparse reward environments is the development of intrinsic motivation mechanisms. Agents equipped with these techniques use internal rewards to explore novel states and behaviors, thereby increasing the probability of encountering external rewards.\n\n- **Self-Supervised Network Distillation (SND):** This method employs distillation error as a novelty signal, guiding exploration toward states where prediction is difficult. Experiments show faster convergence and higher reward attainment compared to traditional baselines in challenging environments.\n- **Random Network Distillation (RND):** Predicting outputs from a fixed random network highlights unexpected states, providing consistent exploration incentives independent of task success.\n- **Count-Based Exploration:** Encourages visiting less-explored states by rewarding inversely proportional visit counts, improving coverage and reducing redundant exploration.\n- **Episodic Memory and Lifelong Novelty:** Techniques such as those in Never Give Up (NGU) combine episodic and long-term novelty to maintain exploratory drives across extended learning periods.\n\nThese approaches enable agents to overcome reward sparsity by proactively seeking out informative experiences.\n\n#### 2.2 Goal-Conditioned and Hierarchical Exploration\n\nDecomposing complex tasks into manageable subgoals facilitates exploration in high-dimensional spaces and sparse reward landscapes.\n\n- **Hierarchical RL (HRL):** Uses high-level controllers to set subgoals for lower-level controllers, simplifying long-horizon planning. Methods like HRL with multi-goal navigation demonstrate improved performance on tasks where single-step reward signals are unattainable.\n- **Goal-Conditioned Policies:** Allow agents to switch goals dynamically, encouraging exploration along diverse trajectories and enhancing sample efficiency.\n- **Skills Discovery and Curriculum Generation:** Algorithms autonomously generate skills relevant to the current environment state, progressively adapting exploration to task demands.\n\nThese methods mirror human-like planning, breaking down complex maneuvers into actionable steps, which is directly applicable to trajectory planning in robotics and autonomous systems.\n\n#### 2.3 Model-Based Active Exploration and Uncertainty\n\nModel-based RL leverages predictions about environment dynamics to plan and execute exploratory actions, focusing effort on uncertain regions.\n\n- **Plan2Explore:** Builds world models to maximize information gain, then leverages these models for effective exploration and planning in previously unseen scenarios.\n- **E-MCTS (Epistemic Monte Carlo Tree Search):** Propagates epistemic uncertainty through search trees, allowing agents to actively seek out ambiguous state transitions, balancing exploration and exploitation intelligently.\n- **Bayesian Ensembles and Active Model Identification:** Multiple learned dynamics models identify regions of high uncertainty, directing exploration towards reducing model ambiguity and accelerating learning.\n\nSuch strategies dramatically improve sample efficiency and enable rapid adaptation to environmental changes—a crucial asset for trajectory planning in dynamic, partially known settings.\n\n#### 2.4 Emerging Trends in Exploration\n\nCurrent research is moving toward integrating multiple objectives and leveraging foundation models. For example, curiosity-driven bonuses are mixed with information-theoretic and multi-goal objectives to enhance robustness. Meta-learning techniques train exploration policies to generalize across different tasks, while foundation models act as priors for targeted exploration in complex domains.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Exploration Under Constraints\n\nSafe RL aims to optimize behavior while respecting predefined constraints, ensuring agents do not violate operational, safety, or legal boundaries during learning and deployment.\n\n#### 3.1 CMDP Formulations and Lagrangian Approaches\n\n- **Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs):** Formalize constraint satisfaction within the RL framework, typically solved via primal-dual optimization or Lagrangian methods.\n- **Lagrangian Policy Gradient and Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO):** Maximize returns subject to constraint budgets, adjusting penalties dynamically to ensure feasibility.\n\nModern algorithms remove restrictive assumptions—such as knowing all safe actions beforehand—and expand applicability to complex, nonlinear contexts.\n\n#### 3.2 Safe Exploration with Hard Instantaneous Constraints\n\nNew approaches address scenarios where agents must avoid unsafe actions at every step, even during learning.\n\n- **LSVI-AE Algorithm:** Achieves minimal regret and constraint violations for both linear and kernelized (RKHS) cost functions. It encourages aggressive exploration without prior knowledge of safe actions, demonstrating strong performance in uncertain environments.\n- **Verification Principles and Barriers:** Methods like VELM provide formal guarantees for safety during training and deployment, reinforcing trust in learned policies.\n\n#### 3.3 Versatile Safe RL and Zero-Shot Adaptation\n\nTo cope with dynamic operational settings, recent work develops frameworks that adapt to varying safety constraints quickly.\n\n- **Constraint-Conditioned Policy Optimization (CCPO):** Employs value estimation and variational inference modules to encode arbitrary constraint thresholds, supporting rapid adaptation without retraining.\n- **Shielded Planning Guided Policy Optimization (SPPO):** Integrates path planning and shielding mechanisms with model predictive control for guaranteed safety during exploration and policy improvement.\n\nThese methods ensure agents maintain safety margins while retaining flexibility and adaptability.\n\n#### 3.4 Verification and Multi-Agent Safety\n\nFormal verification and barrier function approaches are increasingly deployed to certify safe policies in multi-agent and competitive settings, expanding the reach of safe RL beyond single-agent tasks.\n\n#### 3.5 Risk-Sensitive and Distributional RL\n\nRisk-sensitive techniques optimize policies considering uncertainty distributions, while distributional RL incorporates probabilistic outcomes for better constraint management.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Implications for Trajectory Planning Problems\n\nTrajectory planning is the process of determining optimal movement paths for agents, ensuring collision avoidance, smooth motion, and adherence to operational constraints. The advances in exploration and constraint handling directly impact and transform this domain.\n\n#### 4.1 Sample-Efficient Planning in Sparse Reward Settings\n\nBy integrating intrinsic motivation and model-based exploration, agents accelerate learning of viable trajectories even when direct feedback is unavailable. Methods inspired by Go-Explore and E-MCTS promote systematic coverage and prioritization of promising paths, reducing unnecessary exploration in unfamiliar environments.\n\n#### 4.2 Decomposition and Multi-Stage Planning\n\nHierarchical RL and multi-objective reward schemes enable decomposing complex motion tasks into sequential stages—such as approach, adjustment, and completion phases. This mirrors practical trajectory planning in robotics, where joint control and motion smoothing are vital for reliability and performance.\n\n#### 4.3 Safe Trajectory Generation\n\nConstraint-aware algorithms ensure trajectories respect physical and safety boundaries, critical for deployment in robotics, autonomous driving, and industrial automation. Techniques like shielded planning, advantage-based shielding, and zero-shot adaptation allow continuous operation under changing conditions, maintaining safety throughout learning and execution.\n\n#### 4.4 Real-World Case Studies\n\n- **Robotic Arms:** The M2ACD algorithm, featuring dual actor-critic networks and a two-stage reward strategy, demonstrates accelerated convergence and smoother motion than baseline methods.\n- **Autonomous Driving:** Frameworks like Plan-R1 apply language modeling principles to sequential trajectory prediction, enforcing safety, comfort, and compliance via reinforcement fine-tuning.\n- **General-Purpose Robotics:** SPPO provides explicit theoretical guarantees for safe exploration, enabling broader application of RL-based planning in unstructured or hazardous environments.\n\n#### 4.5 Trade-offs and Multi-Objective Optimization\n\nTrajectory planning often involves balancing multiple objectives—speed, energy consumption, safety, and comfort. Constrained and multi-objective RL methods facilitate principled trade-offs, generating policies that optimize overall utility while meeting essential requirements.\n\n#### 4.6 Theoretical Assurance and Risk Bounding\n\nTheoretical results from safe RL provide confidence intervals for planning decisions, quantify learning risks, and bound constraint violations. Such assurances are indispensable for safety-critical deployments, offering both technical rigor and operational reliability.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Open Challenges and Future Directions\n\nDespite significant progress, several challenges persist:\n\n- **Scalability to High-Dimensional Spaces:** Extending exploration and constraint-handling methods to very high-dimensional or continuous action spaces remains technically demanding.\n- **Generalization Across Tasks:** Ensuring learned behaviors transfer effectively to new environments or tasks without retraining is crucial but nontrivial.\n- **Real-Time Performance:** Practical deployment demands solutions with low computational overhead and rapid decision-making capabilities.\n- **Perception Integration:** Incorporating real-world sensor information into planning loops to reduce uncertainty and improve robustness is an active area of research.\n\nFuture research will likely focus on hybrid model-free/model-based strategies, adaptive exploration driven by foundation models, learned barrier functions, and seamless integration of perception and planning.\n\n---\n\n### 6.
